General description/user story/features:
The user will be presented with a square. Inside the square will be a grid of squares (will need to be equal num w and l). The user will be able to click on a square, and the square will change colors. If the user drags the cursor with mouse clicked (held down), each subsequent square that the cursor passes over will have its color chnaged.

There will be a reset button that will clear the sketch.

The will be varying shades of color (from lightest to darkest), corresponding with the number of clicks or hover overs with mouse down. 

Implementation:
There will be a sketch object that has a gridWith that is input by the user. Max 100

Width of each square will be a portion of a fixed width. Maybe achievable through flexbox.

Each square will need to be an object that has a currentColor (or opacity/shade?). Each will need an event listener (delegate to container).

This approach ^^^ may not be efficient. Perhaps possible to use a single array whose length is defined at run time to store a representation of the squares (top left to bottom right)({0: currentColor, 2: currentColor, ...})

If the array approach is taken, then the sketch object will need some CRUD methods etc.

Additional features after working prototype:

Multiple sketch feature

Save multiple sketch feature

Multiple colors with a color picker

Undo functionality

The hardest part about this will be the creation of the grid using flexbox. I am gonna take the approach of using userInput to determine num row divs, then fill each div with userInput num of squares.

CSS thoughts: maybe aspect-ratio will make the squares more flexible.
